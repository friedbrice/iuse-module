# Stopping Distance Module

## Prerequisites

- Derivatives and antiderivatives of polynomials.
- Initial-value problems.
- Piecewise functions.

## Outcomes

- Students will learn to apply antiderivatives and initial-value problems to stopping distance.

## Lesson

E1. Begin with a problem where acceleration is given piecewise as 1 for three seconds, 0 for 6 seconds, and -1 for three seconds, which models a typical car trip. From here, work backwards to find the velocity and then find the position. Graph and find the explicit formulae for each of velocity and position.

## Problems

1. Our car is travelling at a constant velocity of 30 m/s when we spot a priceless painting on the road 100 m in front of us! We apply the brakes, giving our car an acceleration of -5 m/s^2. Putting our initial position as 0 m and the position of the painting as 100 m, find our position when the car comes to a stop (i.e., when velocity is 0). Did we save the painting?

2. We are designing a car, and we need to ensure that it has a stopping distance of 50 m when traveling at a speed of 25 m/s. How much acceleration must the brakes be designed to provide?

3. Our car has brakes that can provide -6 m/s^2 acceleration. Find the stopping distance as a function of velocity, and find the velocity at which the stopping distance becomes 100 m (give your answer in m/s and correct to 2 decimal places).
